    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Aoa, I’m Kulsoom Arif! I’m a dedicated professional with a passion for both education and technology. 
      As the Head of Department, I lead my team with a focus on excellence and innovation. 
      I’m skilled in MS Word, and I enjoy using it to design detailed, high-quality booklets for schools, 
      blending creativity with functionality. Additionally, I have a strong technical background in web 
      development, with expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js. 
      This combination of creative and technical skills allows me to bring ideas to life, 
      whether through engaging educational materials or dynamic web experiences.
